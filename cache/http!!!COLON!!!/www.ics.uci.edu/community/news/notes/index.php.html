<p>
Informatics Ph.D. student <strong>Katherine Lo</strong> has received the Google Anita Borg Memorial Scholarship. The scholarship supports women in technology with a $10,000 financial award for the academic year as well as an invitation to the annual Google Scholars' Retreat, which offers unique professional development and community outreach opportunities, at the Googleplex in Mountain View, Calif. In addition to her Ph.D. studies, Lo is an adviser to the student organization <a href="http://wics.ics.uci.edu/">Women in Information and Computer Sciences</a> (WICS) at UC Irvine. She has previously received an honorable mention from the prestigious NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP).
</p>
<p>
The scholarship is named for the late Dr. Anita Borg, who was committed to dismantling barriers for women and minorities in technology. Google memorializes Dr. Borg through this scholarship in &#8220;hopes to encourage women to excel in computing and technology and become active role models and leaders in the field,&#8221; according to the <a href="http://www.google.com/anitaborg/">scholarship website</a>.

Informatics Professor <strong>Judith Olson</strong> has won many accolades and been widely published over the years, but it&#8217;s not often that you are recognized by the likes of Google Co-founder and CEO Larry Page. In a book recently released titled <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Innovators-Hackers-Geniuses-Revolution/dp/147670869X">The Innovators: How a Group of Hackers, Geniuses, and Geeks Created the Digital Revolution</a>, Page acknowledges the impact Olson had on him as a student: "The college course that made the greatest impression on me was one on human-computer interaction taught by Judith Olson. The goal was to understand how to design interfaces that were easy and intuitive."

<p>
Three graduate students from the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences (ICS) have just received the prestigious National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship (NSF GRFP). Informatics students <strong>Oliver Haimson</strong> and <strong>Van Erick Custodio</strong> and statistics student <strong>Maricela Cruz</strong> join 2,000 students nationwide to be awarded the fellowship in 2015. Informatics student <strong>Katherine Lo</strong> also received an honorable mention in the highly competitive program. Haimson, Custodio and Cruz contribute to UC Irvine&#8217;s 35 total awardees in 2015, while Lo joins an additional 37 honorable mentions across campus.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I'm very humbled by this award to be included in such great company both present and those that came before,&#8221; says Custodio. &#8220;My research will greatly benefit from this award in that it gives me the freedom to explore the far reaches of my imagination. Receiving the NSF GRFP award allows me to broadly share the story I have to tell through my research. I am excited about the difference in the world my research can make because of this fellowship. This, I hope, is the first of many signs that my work has potential to contribute to the research community and society at large.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Founded in 1952, the <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=6201">NSF GRFP</a> provides graduate students in the early stages of their research with three years of support, including a $34,000 annual stipend and a $12,000 cost-of-education allowance to their institution. Fellows enjoy supercomputer access, as well as the opportunity to participate in the Graduate Research Intern Program (GRIP) and the Graduate Research Opportunities Worldwide Program (GROW). Past GRFP recipients have gone on to make significant scientific and engineering breakthroughs, with some even becoming Nobel laureates.

<p><b> Mimi <br/> Ito </b></p>
</div>
<p>
South by Southwest&#8217;s education conference (<a href="http://sxswedu.com/">SXSWedu</a>) held in Austin, Texas, invited research scientist <strong>Mimi Ito</strong> to present at its newly formed <a href="http://sxswedu.com/closing-program">closing program</a> in March. Ito discussed &#8220;connected learning,&#8221; the concept of harnessing information and social connectivity for education. She presented alongside GRAMMY Museum Executive Director Bob Santelli, actress and founder of Hawn Foundation Goldie Hawn, and Khan Academy founder and Executive Director Sal Khan.
</p>
<p>
The single-stage closing program highlighted unique educational convergences by exploring education through the lens of music, film and interactive technologies. &#8220;The closing session is a new format, and intended to bridge the education and interactive programs,&#8221; Ito says. &#8220;I think it is an important signal that we need to find ways to unite the social agenda of educational reform to innovative technology approaches.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Ito&#8217;s discussion of connected learning advocated for using today's tools to advance the longstanding goals of progressive education. &#8220;Too often, new educational technologies are used to reinforce traditional forms of education which we know are not effective or empowering to the learner. We have the opportunity to change that,&#8221; she says.

<p><b> Ankita <br/> Raturi </b></p>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Ankita Raturi</strong>, a graduate student in informatics, is one of five UC Irvine students who have been awarded $2,500 fellowships to fund projects that focus on food issues. They&#8217;re among 54 University of California students receiving support from UC President Janet Napolitano&#8217;s Global Food Initiative Student Fellowship Program for efforts addressing such subjects as community gardens, food pantries, urban agriculture and food waste.
</p>
<p>
Raturi will work to develop a software program that models the environmental impact of agricultural systems. Called the Open Resource Tracker, the program will be designed to help understand how resources flow both within and between food systems. The software could theoretically be used with any resource-consuming system (e.g., farms, restaurants, factories). While the primary audience for this tool will be those directly involved in the environmental assessment of food systems &#8212;farmers, analysts and government workers &#8212; it will also have a consumer-facing interface.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="http://www.ucop.edu/initiatives/global-food-initiative.html">Global Food Initiative</a> was launched in July to align the UC&#8217;s research, outreach and operations in a sustained effort to develop, demonstrate and export solutions &#8212; throughout California, the United States and the world &#8212; for food security, health and sustainability.

Theoretical computer science at ICS scores in the top 20 computer science departments nationally, according to a ranking list developed collaboratively by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the University of Maryland.
</p>
<p>
The list, titled &#8220;<a href="http://projects.csail.mit.edu/dnd/ranking/">Ranking of CS Departments based on the Number of Papers in Theoretical Computer Science</a>,&#8221; was developed in response to a perceived lack of transparency in the criteria for <i><a href="http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-science-schools/computer-theory-rankings">U.S. News and World Report&#8217;s</a></i> Best Graduate Schools for theoretical computer science list. Theoretical computer science includes a focus on logic and mathematics. The list considers the quality of computer science department faculty at respective schools and publication rates in major computer science conferences as key ranking measures. It is a part of a larger MIT and University of Maryland collaborative project, titled &#8220;BigDND: Big Dynamic Network Data.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
There are two ranking lists, each developed with the same dataset but using a different equation to organize the data. Depending on the list, computer science at UC Irvine comes in at 18th or 19th place, beating out Ivy League schools like Harvard and Yale.
</p>
<p>
Chancellor's Professor <strong>Michael Goodrich</strong> attributes UC Irvine&#8217;s placement on the list to the work coming out of the Center for Algorithms and Theory of Computation, of which he is technical director and Chancellor&#8217;s Professor <strong>David Eppstein</strong> is director. The center&#8217;s research seeks to produce rigorously tested results about problems dealing with computers and their applications. In a recent example, professor <strong>Sandy Irani</strong>, in collaboration with professor Shahram Ghandeharizadeh at USC, has developed several novel algorithms for managing key-value caches for database management systems that greatly reduce processing overhead and enhance system throughput.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I think this ranking data is an excellent recognition of impact the faculty in the center are having on the area,&#8221; Goodrich says.

The list is currently a Beta version; the developers welcome feedback at <a href="mailto:csdepartmentranking@gmail.com">csdepartmentranking@gmail.com</a>.

<p>
The National Science Foundation (NSF) has awarded informatics and computer science professor <strong>Alfred Kobsa</strong> $666,000 to research user privacy decision support.
</p>
<p>
Even though consumers want to be in charge of their privacy and current privacy norms and research recommend transparency and user control, expecting all users to make all privacy decisions themselves turns out to be unrealistic. Kobsa&#8217;s proposal, &#8220;A User-Tailored Approach to Privacy Decision Support,&#8221; seeks to realistically empower users for privacy choices, through personalized default settings and through rationales for disclosure that best suit users&#8217; predicted decision-making. Throughout his research, he will work with industry to deploy solutions for privacy decision support.
</p>
<p>
The research is funded by the NSF Social &amp; Economic Sciences (SES) division, which &#8220;seeks to enhance our understanding of human, social and organizational behavior by building social science infrastructure, by developing social disciplinary and interdisciplinary research projects that advance knowledge in the social and economic sciences,&#8221; according to the <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/sbe/ses/about.jsp">website</a>.

The National Science Foundation (NSF) has awarded informatics professor <strong>Bill Tomlinson</strong> $400,000 for his project &#8220;Fostering Non-Expert Creation of Sustainable Polycultures through Crowdsourced Data Synthesis.&#8221; Associate professor <strong>Donald Patterson</strong> and Assistant Professor of Crop Sciences at the University of Illinois Sarah Taylor Lovell serve as co-principal investigators.
</p>
<p>
The project integrates research in computing and sustainability science with the goal of enabling a new approach to sustainable food security. By combining cyber-human systems and crowdsourcing research with the science of agroecology, the project seeks to develop an understanding of how online design tools may contribute to sustainability through enhanced local food production; to use the process of populating a plant species database as an instance of a class of problems amenable to intelligent crowdsourcing; and to pioneer new knowledge in crowdsourcing optimization.
</p>
<p>
According to the <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1442749">project abstract</a>, &#8220;The work will contribute to long-term food security and offer lessons, concepts, methods, and software tools that may be transferable to other sustainability challenges.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
The award is part of the Cyber-Innovation for Sustainability Science and Engineering (CyberSEES) program at NSF, and is funded through the Division of Computing and Communication Foundations (CCF), which supports research and education projects that explore the foundations of computing and communication devices and their usage. According to the <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/cise/ccf/about.jsp">CCF website</a>, &#8220;CCF-supported projects also investigate revolutionary computing models and technologies based on emerging scientific ideas and integrate research and education activities to prepare future generations of computer science and engineering workers.&#8221;
